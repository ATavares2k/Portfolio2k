My ups and downs, my errors and trials———this is my portfolio.
Here are some of my own projects where i've cried and cheered myself while creating something that I can truly call my own, my mark in this world.
Still, I ask you, how many people can say they've done that? Not me or you, maybe a australopithecus ?!
The wheel was already invented, everything that comes from it, even with its differences, is a copy of that.
So how can I call this portfolio my creation?....
Don't stress yourself, it's just philosophy. Enjoy it.
